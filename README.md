### A Language based on [Propositional Calculus Î©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus)
### It supports [Expression Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression-oriented_programming_language)

## Installation

#### 2. `cd Logico`
#### 3. `npm -g install` 
After installation
type `logico` and press enter in the terminal and the REPL will Start

## Introduction 

### `Propositional Calculus` or `zeroth-order logic`,
Is a branch of logic concerned with the study of propositions (whether they are true or false) that are formed by other propositions with the use of logical connectives.

## Fundamental Building Blocks (Values and Operators)

### Truth Values in Logico
| Truth Value | Logico |
|-------------|--------|
| true        | T      |
| false       | F      |

### Logical Connectives (Operators) in Logico
| Logical Connectives  	  | Operator 	| Equivalent in English       |
|------------------------	|----------	|---------------------------	|
| Negation               	| -A       	| not A                       |
| Conjunction            	| A ^ B    	| A and B                    	|
| Disjunction            	| A v B    	| A or B                    	|
| Implication            	| A > B    	| if A then B                 |
| Biconditional          	| A = B    	| A if and only if B          |

## Expressions

In Logico you can write Propsitional Expressions and Evaluate them
``` 
( ( -(T ^ F) v (-F) ) ^ F ) 
``` 
This Expression will evaluate to `F`

## Composite Expressions

In Logico Everything is an Expression therefore Everything has to be inside `(...)` brackets

You can also write multiple expressions inside an expression and the last expression will be the final evaluation of the enclosing expression
```
( (-T) (F ^ T) (F) (T) )
``` 
Enclosing Expression will evaluate to `T`

## Variables 

In Logico Variables can Store Expressions and Variables are Expressions

Variables are Lazily Evaluated

```
(A: T)
(B: (T ^ F = F ^ T))
(A v B)
```
## Memoization of Variables inside Variables (Thunking or Nullary Functions)
Variable Defination inside of another variable defination is memoized (stored as a thunk) and partially evaluated as shown below
```
(B: -(A: T)) -> (B: -A) [A is defined and the expression partially evaluated]
```

## Examples
> You can try this in the REPL

#### if ( (if A then B) and A ) then B 
#### Prove that for Every value of A and B it Evaluates to T

```
( e: ( ( ( A > B ) ^ A ) > B ) )

( ( A : T ) ( B : T ) )

(e)

( ( A : F ) ( B : T ) )

(e)

( ( A : T ) ( B : F ) )

(e)

( ( A : F ) ( B : F ) )

(e)
```
